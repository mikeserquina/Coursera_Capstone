Aside from all those people, it is also the address of the country's Central Business District, making it a very popular place to open establishments of all categories and at all price points.\n\nEstablishments in this area normally 'trend': as one establishment (say, a bar) in one area begins to gain popularity and foot traffic, adjacent complementary establishments -- in this example, coffee shops, restaurants, and other bars -- also enjoy an increase in patronage. The buyer behavior here is driven by the difficulty of parking in the city; once patrons have found parking for their vehicles, the consumer preference leans heavily toward carrying out all their plans (eating, having a coffee, some drinks) in establishments that are walking distance from each other."

Intersections of an arbitrary 'walking distance' radius would be ranked higher, since they would have a higher expected benefit due to overlapping effect of nearby popular establishments.\n\n##### Conceptual objective / output of analysis:\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/qJpQKN5\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/9ZW56bt/Presentation1.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation1\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nThe business application of the analysis would be the objective recommendation of locations that could be up-and-coming: not popular yet (hence rent and other expenses may not be as high as in the hotspots), but hold promise for becoming popular in the next 18-36 months due to proximity to other popular destinations."
